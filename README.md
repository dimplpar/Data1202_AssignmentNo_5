# Introduction
•This python code imports csv file.

•It also runs few queries over the data imported from the file

# Steps
PART 1:
1. We have imported the required library to get started with pandas. "pandas" is the library which we have imported which imports all the inbuilt functionality associated with python.

2.Then, we have specified the path for the csv file. The csv file named "vgsales.csv" contains few records of the sales.

3.Additonally, we are fetching data from the csv file and are printing it using the inbuilt 'read_csv()' function. We have also created a variable 'input_raw_data' to store the output of the function.

4.Lastly, we have created a variable named 'between_00_05' which only retreives records from the year 2000 to 2005. 

5.We have used an inbuilt function print() to print the content of the variable 'between_00_05'.
